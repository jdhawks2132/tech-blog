# Hawks Tech Blog

## Description

This is a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. This site was built using the MVC paradigm in mind, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

## Installing Dependencies

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```
npm i
```

## MySQL Database Setup

To set up the database, run the following command:

```
mysql -u root -p
```

Then, source the schema.sql file:

```
source db/schema.sql
```

Finally, seed the database:

```
source db/seeds.sql
```

## Create a .env file

Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add the following:

```
DB_NAME='tech_blog_db'
DB_USER='root'
DB_PW='your password'
```
